My specific research efforts in the academic year of 2000 to 2001
focused on French to English translation systems. I conducted an
evaluation of the current Machine Translation system under development
in the Natural Language group at ISI, which is a statistically-based
system built with a focus on political language. The data used to
build this system was from the proceedings of the Canadian Parliament,
which are available in both English and French, and which have a high
translation quality. I performed a variety of experiments on the
system which were focused on evaluating its performance for a
different domain, newspaper translatio, and then worked on
improvements to the modeling aimed at improving the systems
performance. Aside from the empirical results, which showed
improvement, I exposed several potential flaws in the previous
modeling process, and have proposed further research on how to improve
the performance of the system on data which contains significant
amounts of noise.

I attended two conferences in the past academic year. The West Coast
Conference on Formal Linguistics is a regional conference focusing on
recent developments in Generative Syntax. This conference was useful
to my research because of recent paradigm changes in theories of how
humans cope with morphology (the formation of words). These theories
are directly relevant to computational models of translation because
it is important to show how words which are morphologically similar
are related.

The North American Association of Computational Linguistics was the
other conference I attended. This conference is the most important
conference for Computational Linguistics which was held in North
America this year. At this conference I was able to meet the major
researchers working at American institutions on the Machine
Translation problem. This was an invaluable experience to discuss
recent advances in the field, and provided me with an opportunity to
talk with other researchers about the need for a concerted effort to
acquire more data for training data-driven systems.
