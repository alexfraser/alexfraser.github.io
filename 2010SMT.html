<H1>Statistical Machine Translation</H1>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>The success of statistical machine translation systems such as
Moses, Language Weaver, Google Translate and many others, has shown that it is
possible to build high performance machine translation systems with a
small amount of effort using statistical learning techniques.

<P>After several introductory lectures by Alex Fraser we will alternate informal
presentations of research papers by members of the group. Our initial
goal is to reach the point where we are able to read about and discuss
new ideas in statistical machine translation research involving the
integration of linguistic representations ranging from deep to
shallow.

<P>The language of the course is English.

<P>Schein: if you are interested in a Schein for this SS 2010 course,
please let us know by email. We expect this would be a presentation of
a research paper taken from the literature, preferably in English
(however, if several students are interested we might reserve one or
two days for presentations in German).
