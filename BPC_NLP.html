<H2>Bachelor Practical Course Projects in Natural Language Processing</H2>

<H2>Summary</H2>

<P>Studying natural language processing is timely and important because it enables machines to understand and generate human language, powering transformative technologies like chatbots, translation systems, and AI-driven communication in an increasingly digital world.

<P>Contents:

<P>Students will be organized into small groups to carry out practical projects on a wide range of topics at the intersection of natural language processing and machine learning (e.g., ranging from hate speech detection to engineering state-of-the-art machine learning models to evaluating ChatGPT).

<P>Students:
  
<P>This class is offered to TUM Information Engineering students (located in Heilbronn) as well as to TUM Computer Science students and related areas (located in Garching and downtown Munich).
