<H2>Bachelors in Information Engineering at TUM Campus Heilbronn</H2>

<H2>Summary</H2>

<P>I receive many emails asking for advice about whether to pursue TUM's program in Information Engineering or TUM's program in Computer Science. I teach in Information Engineering, see below.

<P>Both programs are 3 year bachelors programs resulting in a Bachelor of Science, and cover the core contents of computer science. Both courses require a roughly 30-page thesis, typically written in the 6th semester.

<P>The biggest difference between TUM Information Engineering (IE) and TUM Computer Science (CS) is that IE is offered entirely in English, while CS requires knowledge of German.

<P>IE is located at the newer modern campus of TUM in Heilbronn (not far from Stuttgart). CS is mostly located in Garching, a small town near Munich, but some courses are in downtown Munich.
  
<P>IE has a stronger emphasis on interdisciplinarity including the application of machine learning to diverse problems. CS has a stronger emphasis on core mathematics and theory. 

<P>My team and I teach discrete probability theory, machine learning and natural language processing courses in the IE program.
