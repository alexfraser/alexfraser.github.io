<H2>Masters in Information Engineering at TUM Campus Heilbronn</H2>

<H2>Summary</H2>

<P>I receive many emails asking for advice about whether to pursue TUM's program in Information Engineering or TUM's program in Computer Science. I teach in Information Engineering, see below.

<P>Both programs are 2 year masters programs resulting in a Master of Science, and cover the core contents of computer science. Both courses require a roughly 60-page thesis, typically written in the 4th semester.

<P>The biggest difference between TUM Information Engineering (IE) and TUM Computer Science (CS) is that IE is offered entirely in English, while some courses in CS may require knowledge of German.

<P>IE is located at the newer modern campus of TUM in Heilbronn (not far from Stuttgart). CS is mostly located in Garching, a small town near Munich, but some courses are in downtown Munich.
  
<P>IE has a stronger emphasis on interdisciplinarity including the application of machine learning to diverse problems. CS has a stronger emphasis on core mathematics and theory. 

<P>My team and I teach machine learning and natural language processing courses in the Masters IE program.
