Frauke Kreuter and I have a new interdisciplinary project with the Bundesbank (German Central Bank) on using NLP for analyzing corpora sustainability reports with a focus on green indicators. We are hiring for a start very soon, see <A HREF="https://job-portal.lmu.de/jobposting/4c16ef82e1508f91440e8494a181504d0271f74a0?ref=homepage">here</A>.
<p>

<li>
Some great work being presented at EMNLP 2023 and the Workshop on Multilingual Representation Learning. Viktor and others have a paper on using anchors and chains to learn embeddings for low-resource languages. Lavine and Alexandra have a paper on data imbalance and representation degeneration in multilingual MT. Marion and Kathy have a paper on accessing linguistic information in LLMs. Congrats!
<p>

<p>

<li>
Kathy has two papers in Findings of ACL 2023 which she will present in Toronto. The first one is on moral reasoning across languages in multilingual language models (with Jindrich and Darmstadt people in Kristian Kersting's lab), and the second one is on outlier dimensions in multilingual language models (with Alina and Jindrich). Lihong Liu, Alexandra and Hinrich have a paper at IWSLT on the copying problem in unsupervised NMT. Congratulations! See the <a href="research.html">publications</a> page.

<li>Fabienne Cap presented <a href="pubs/cap_eacl2014.pdf">our paper</a> on producing German compounds in English to German Translation at EACL in Göteborg.
<p>

<li>We integrated <a href="http://hunch.net/~vw">Vowpal Wabbit</a> into the open source Moses statistical machine translation system, and <a href="http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pbml/101/art-tamchyna-et-al.pdf">the paper</a> is in the Prague Bulletin of Mathematical Linguistics. This is one of the outcomes of the Johns Hopkins Workshop on Domain Adaptation. 
<p>

<li><b>I was a <a href="http://www.cl.uni-heidelberg.de/~fraser">visiting professor</a> at the Universität Heidelberg</b> in Summer Semester 2014, representing the professorship in Linguistic Computer Science (Linguistische Informatik). I am back in Munich for Winter Semester 2014/2015.
<p>

<li>Our <a href="http://www.dagstuhl.de/de/programm/kalender/semhp/?semnr=14061">Dagstuhl Seminar on Statistical Techniques for Translating to Morphologically Rich Languages</a> was very interesting. It was organized in part by the <A HREF="morphosyntax_for_smt.html">Morphosyntax for Statistical Machine Translation project</A>. The organizers were Alexander Fraser, Kevin Knight, Philipp Koehn, Helmut Schmid, and Hans Uszkoreit. The seminar took place in the first week of February 2014.
<p>

<li>We did well at the <A HREF="http://www.statmt.org/wmt13/results.html">2013 shared task</a> on machine translation, see our <A HREF="research.html">three shared task papers</A>
<p>

<li>The paper <a href="pubs/durrani_acl2013.pdf">Can Markov Models Over Minimal Translation Units Help Phrase-Based SMT?</a> was presented by Nadir Durrani at ACL 2013
<p>

<li>The paper <a href="pubs/weller_acl2013.pdf">Using Subcategorization Knowledge to Improve Case Prediction for Translation to German<a> was presented by Marion Weller at ACL 2013
<p>

<li>The paper <a href="pubs/durrani_naacl2013.pdf">Model With Minimal Translation Units, But Decode With Phrases</a> was presented by Nadir Durrani at NAACL 2013
<p>

<li>The second phase of the <A HREF="morphosyntax_for_smt.html">Morphosyntax for SMT project</A> was approved by the German Research Foundation (DFG)!

<p>

<li>I gave a keynote talk at <A HREF="http://www.taln2013.org/">TALN 2013</A> on translating to morphologically richer languages
<p>

<li>I have moved to the CIS at the University of Munich (LMU München), but am still often in Stuttgart at the IMS. 
<p>

<li>Our <a href="http://www.dagstuhl.de/de/programm/kalender/semhp/?semnr=14061">Dagstuhl Seminar on Statistical Techniques for Translating to Morphologically Rich Languages</a> has been accepted, which is great news for the <A HREF="morphosyntax_for_smt.html">Morphosyntax for SMT project</A>. The organizers are Alexander Fraser, Kevin Knight, Philipp Koehn, Helmut Schmid, and Hans Uszkoreit. The seminar will take place in February 2014. Sixty top researchers will be invited to have free-ranging discussions of how to move forward on this important problem.

<li><A HREF="http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/~durrani">Nadir Durrani</A> passed his defense, congratulations! His topic: A Joint Translation Model With Integrated Reordering. He has accepted a position with Philipp Koehn at University of Edinburgh.
<p>

<li>I will serve as a tutorials chair at <A HREF="http://www.aclweb.org">ACL 2014</A> in Baltimore, looking forward to your applications.
<p>

<li>Congratulations to <A HREF="http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/~sajjad">Hassan Sajjad</A> for passing his defense! His topic: Statistical Models for Unsupervised, Semi-supervised and Supervised Transliteration Mining. He has accepted a position with Stephan Vogel and Preslav Nakov at the Qatar Computing Research Institute.
<p>

<li>I was an organizer of the <A HREF="http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/archive/ws-12/groups/dasmt">Johns Hopkins Summer Workshop on Domain Adaptation for Machine Translation</A>. This involved 6 weeks of intensive work on taking advantage of out-of-domain data in translation, conducted by 13 researchers on location at the Center for Language and Speech Processing at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
<p>

<li>Paper accepted to Computational Linguistics Journal: Knowledge Sources for Constituent Parsing of German, a Morphologically Rich and Less-Configurational Language, by Alexander Fraser, Helmut Schmid, Richard Farkas, Renjing Wang, Hinrich Schuetze (<A HREF="pubs/fraser_cl2013.txt">abstract</A> &nbsp <a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/COLI_a_00135">preprint</A>)
<p>

<li>I taught Statistical Machine Translation at the <A HREF="http://nssnlp.ku.edu.np">Summer School in Advanced Language Engineering</A> at Kathmandu University in Nepal in September 2012. This was supported by a DAAD grant. We had participants from Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka (participants from Bangladesh and Bhutan were also invited, but were unable to attend).
