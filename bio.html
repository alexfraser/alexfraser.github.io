<H2>Short Bio in Third Person</H2>

<p>Alexander Fraser is a full professor at the Center for Information
  and Language Processing, LMU Munich, where he leads the Multilingual
  Natural Language Processing and Machine Translation Group. Before
  that, he led the Machine Translation Group at the Institute for
  Natural Language Processing at the University of Stuttgart. He is also
  a PI in the Munich Center for Machine Learning.

<p>He has received two European Research Council grants and was a PI
  of the Horizon 2020 "Health in my Language" project.
  His main research interests are in multilingual representation learning, 
  machine translation, syntactic parsing and
  information retrieval.

<p>Alex obtained his PhD in 2007 from the Department of Computer
  Science at the University of Southern California. His PhD research
  was conducted at the Information Sciences Institute in the
  Intelligent Systems Division. In addition to his academic work, Alex
  has worked at Language Weaver, where he developed the first
  commercially-available statistical machine translation system, and
  at BBN Technologies, where he worked on Arabic monolingual and
  cross-language information retrieval. Before starting his PhD
  studies, Alex held a number of positions including technical
  director at SatelLife/HealthNet, working on digital infrastructure
  for health information in developing countries.

<H2>Long Bio in First Person</H2>

<P>
<P>I am a full professor at
<a href="http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de">the Center for Information and
Language Processing (CIS)</a>, LMU Munich, where I lead the 
Multilingual
  Natural Language Processing and Machine Translation Group.
Before this, I led the Machine Translation
Group at the <a href="http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de">Institute for Natural
  Language Processing (IMS)</a>, University of Stuttgart.
I am also
a PI in the <a href="http://mcml.ai">Munich Center for Machine Learning (MCML)</a>.


<P>I have received two European Research Council grants and was a PI in the Horizon2020 project
  <a href="http://www.himl.eu">Health in my Language (HimL)</a>.
  My main research interests are in multilingual representation learning, 
  machine translation, syntactic parsing and
  information retrieval. In general I am interested in the intersection between
  natural language processing and machine learning.

<P>
I defended my PhD in July 2007. I was in the <A
HREF="http://www.cs.usc.edu/">Department of Computer Science</A> at
the <A HREF="http://www.usc.edu">University of Southern
California</A>, located in Los Angeles. The topic of my dissertation was
"Improved Word Alignments for Statistical Machine Translation"
and my advisor was <B><A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/~marcu">Daniel
Marcu</A></B>. In addition to Daniel, Eduard Hovy, Gareth James, Kevin
Knight and Paul Rosenbloom were on my committee. I obtained my
M.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Southern California in
2002, and my B.A. in Computer Science and Economics, with a
concentration in Linguistics, in 1995 from the University of Massachusetts,
Boston.

<P>
During my PhD studies I worked on statistical machine translation in the <A
HREF="http://www.isi.edu/natural-language/nlp-at-isi.html">Natural
Language Group</A> at the <A HREF="http://www.isi.edu">Information
Sciences Institute</A> in Marina del Rey (near Los Angeles). We used
statistical models to implement machine translation from a variety of
languages to English. I also worked on discourse analysis.

<P>
From June 2003 to May 2004 I worked
at <A HREF="http://www.languageweaver.com">Language Weaver</A> where I
managed the development of a machine translation system which
automatically creates high quality English translations of Arabic
documents.
This was the first commercially-available statistical machine translation
system, available almost two years before Google Translate.
Managing the transfer of research technology into a
commercial product, which had to be robust, was a useful
experience very different from the issues in academic laboratories.

<P>
In the summer of 2003, I took part in an interesting workshop
on <A HREF="http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/ws2003/groups/translate">Syntax
for Statistical Machine Translation</A> at the Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore. Our group was led by Franz Och and Dan Gildea
and our goal was to incorporate syntactic structure into a
phrase-based statistical machine translation system. In the summer of
2012, I had the opportunity to return to lead a group (together with
Marine Carpuat, Hal Daume and Chris Quirk) working on the problem
of <A HREF="http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/archive/ws-12/groups/dasmt/">Domain
Adaptation in Statistical Machine Translation</A>, which was a great experience.

<P>
I have also worked at <A HREF="http://www.bbn.com">BBN Technologies</A>, in the
Speech and Language Processing Group. My last project there was a
cross-language information retrieval system where the queries were in
English and the documents searched were in Arabic.

<P>
I used to work in the area of International Development, providing
technical assistance to developing countries, and I am still strongly
interested in this area and in development economics. I was the
technical director at an NGO (non-profit) called SatelLife which
involved work on ICTs for public health, where I managed the
international HealthNet network and created the technical
infrastructure for ProMED-mail. This involved work on location in a
number of countries in Eastern, Western and Southern Africa, as well
as Bolivia and Haiti.

<P>
Travel is one of my interests, I've spent significant time in Germany,
Spain, France, Mexico, Yemen and Syria. I speak English, French,
German and Spanish fluently, and am proficient in Arabic.
I also have
a <A HREF="http://www.xand.net">personal web site</A> which primarily
contains information on studying Arabic that I gathered during my
year-long stay in the Middle East in 1998.
