<H1>Parsing and Machine Translation</H1>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>The success of statistical machine translation systems such as
Moses, Language Weaver, Google Translate and many others, has shown that it is
possible to build high performance machine translation systems with a
small amount of effort using statistical learning techniques.

<P>It is already clear that statistical parsing will be a key technology for future
approaches to statistical machine translation.

<P>After several introductory lectures by Alex Fraser and Helmut Schmid we will alternate informal
presentations of research papers by members of the group. Our initial
goal is to reach the point where we are able to read about and discuss
new ideas in statistical machine translation research involving the
integration of linguistic representations ranging from deep to
shallow.
