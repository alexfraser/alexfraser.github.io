<P>
If you are interested in visiting the CIS and 
would be interested in working with me I encourage you
to send me an email.

<P>
You should address the email to me personally, and indicate which of the
research areas I work in you would be interested in working on. Give
me an idea of what sort of research you have worked on previously,
coursework you found particularly interesting, and an indication of
your programming experience. It would also be useful to know which
(human) languages you know. Ideally, you would include a full academic
CV, but this is not strictly necessary for brief inquiries.
<P>
Please also indicate how you will be supported during this period (for
instance, several of the students who have visited have had support
from the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), while others have
had fellowships from their home countries).
<P>
