<li>
We are advertising a PhD position and postdoc position, located at TUM in Heilbronn (near Stuttgart). See the <a href="jobs">jobs page</a>
<p>

<li>
Welcome to Dr. Shu Okabe, a new postdoc in the group working on the ERC Proof of Concept project and related low resource language technologies!
<p>  
  
<li>
I am a senior area chair (for Machine Translation) at <a href="https://2024.emnlp.org">EMNLP 2024</a> in Miami.
<p>

<li>
<b>I have moved to TUM computer science!</b> New job update: I have started the chaired professorship for Data
Analytics & Statistics at the computer science department of the
Technical University of Munich (TUM) in the School of Computation,
Information and Technology.
My main functions at TUM will be at the new campus in Heilbronn (near
Stuttgart). But I will also be in Munich and Garching occasionally.
I'd like to thank the current and past members of my research team for
their great work!
Thanks also to my former colleagues at CIS and LMU Munich, and to the
entire CIS community.

<p>

<li>
Frauke Kreuter and I have a new interdisciplinary project with the Bundesbank (German Central Bank) on using NLP for analyzing corpora sustainability reports with a focus on green indicators. We are hiring for a start very soon, see <A HREF="https://job-portal.lmu.de/jobposting/4c16ef82e1508f91440e8494a181504d0271f74a0?ref=homepage">here</A>.
<p>

<li>
Some great work being presented at EMNLP 2023 and the Workshop on Multilingual Representation Learning. Viktor and others have a paper on using anchors and chains to learn embeddings for low-resource languages. Lavine and Alexandra have a paper on data imbalance and representation degeneration in multilingual MT. Marion and Kathy have a paper on accessing linguistic information in LLMs. Congrats!
<p>

<lI>
I've joined the ELLIS Munich Unit, see <A HREF="https://www.ellismunich.ai/faculty/index.html">here</A>. ELLIS is the European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems.
<p>

<li>
I am a senior area chair (for Machine Translation) at <a href="https://2024.naacl.org">NAACL 2024</a> in Mexico City.
<p>

<li>
Kathy has two papers in Findings of ACL 2023 which she will present in Toronto. The first one is on moral reasoning across languages in multilingual language models (with Jindrich and Darmstadt people in Kristian Kersting's lab), and the second one is on outlier dimensions in multilingual language models (with Alina and Jindrich). Lihong Liu, Alexandra and Hinrich have a paper at IWSLT on the copying problem in unsupervised NMT. Congratulations! See the <a href="research.html">publications</a> page.
<p>
  
<li>
I am a senior area chair (for Machine Translation) at <a href="https://2023.emnlp.org">EMNLP 2023</a> in Singapore.
<p>

<li>Sophie has a survey paper on unbalanced distributions at EACL 2023 with William Beluch and Annemarie Friedrich, while Alexandra has a Findings of EACL paper on domain adaptation with Matt Peters and Jesse Dodge, and a paper at the Workshop on Technologies for Machine Translation of Low-Resource Languages (at EACL), with Dario. Congratulations and have fun presenting!
<p>
  
<li>Viktor Hangya's DFG proposal on transfer learning for hate speech detection was accepted, congratulations! Viktor is <A HREF="https://www.cis.lmu.de/~hangyav/">hiring</A>.
<p>
  
<li>I received an ERC Proof of Concept grant "Data for Multilingual Learning (DATA4ML)"! This will create a real world demonstrator for the work we did in my ERC Starting Grant on Domain Adaptation. The main focus here is on creating a tool to help minority language activists find and create multilingual data for training machine translation systems and language models for their languages, but our work will enable the creation of domain-specific models for companies as well. Here is the press release in <A HREF="https://www.lmu.de/en/newsroom/news-overview/news/two-lmu-research-projects-awarded-erc-grants.html">English</A> and <A HREF="https://www.lmu.de/de/newsroom/newsuebersicht/news/erc-grants-zwei-forschungsprojekte-der-lmu-ausgezeichnet.html">German</A>.
<p>

<li> I was interviewed by the Handelsblatt newspaper about Facebook's open source AI strategy, which I strongly support. We have used Facebook models in many of our research projects, such as studies on cultural moral norms in LLMs and on transfer learning for cross-lingual hatespeech detection. <a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/technik/it-internet/ki-meta-greift-microsoft-und-google-im-ki-wettstreit-an/29108914.html">Excerpts from the interview</a> (in German).
<p>
  
<li>The journal version of our <a HREF="pubs/bigoulaeva_lrev2023.pdf">paper on cross-lingual transfer learning for hate speech detection</A> has been published, congratulations Irina, Viktor and Iryna!
