You are looking for a data science professorship in Europe at a
top-ranked computer science department.

Question: can you get the advantages of both a small department and a
large department at the same time?

The answer: yes! Join our team at the Technical University of Munich in
Heilbronn!

You will be part of a tightly-knit team of 15 CS and CE professors who
teach in Heilbronn together, as well as part of the new Heilbronn Data
Science Center. But at the same time your faculty membership will be
at the TUM School of Computation, Information and Technology, with all
the advantages of a large department, such as excellent resources and
collaboration opportunities!

The application deadline for all three open-rank positions is May
25th 2025.

A few other things: all teaching at TUM Campus Heilbronn is 100% in
English, the location is at a multi-university educational campus (the
"Bildungscampus"), and Heilbronn is located in a beautiful region on
the Neckar River known for its vineyards and cuisine.
