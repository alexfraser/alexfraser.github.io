Translation
<p>

<pre>
There are three student assistant (Studentische Hilfskraft) positions
available in a DFG project at the Institut für Maschinelle
Sprachverarbeitung in Vaihingen.

Position 1: C++

Position 2: Java

Position 3: Perl or Python, human language data analysis

(more details below!)

The positions are in the DFG project "Models of Morphosyntax for
Statistical Machine Translation". The goal of this project is to
improve statistical machine translation using linguistic knowledge,
with a particular focus on translating to morphologically rich
languages such as German.

For position 1, knowledge of C++, interest in open source software,
and good knowledge of English are required. Desirable: Git (version
control), interest in machine translation and syntactic parsing

For position 2, knowledge of Java, interest in open source software,
and good knowledge of English are required. Desirable: GUI
engineering, interest in machine translation and syntactic parsing

For position 3, knowledge of Perl or Python, Linux and very good
English and German language analysis skills are required. Desirable:
knowledge of morphologically rich languages (such as languages in the
Finno-Ugric, Romance, Semitic, Slavic, etc., families), knowledge
of syntactic parsing, interest in machine translation

Please apply by email to: fraser@ims.uni-stuttgart.de

In the application, please make clear which position(s) you are
applying for, computer language knowledge, human language knowledge,
relevant course work and work experience.
