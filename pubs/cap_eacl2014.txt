How to Produce Unseen Teddy Bears: Improved Morphological Processing of Compounds in SMT. 

Fabienne Cap, Alexander Fraser, Marion Weller, Aoife Cahill

Compounding in morphologically rich languages is a highly productive
process which often causes SMT approaches to fail because of unseen
words.  We present an approach for translation into a compounding
language that splits compounds into simple words for training and,
due to an underspecified representation, allows for free merging of
simple words into compounds after translation. In contrast to
previous approaches, we use features projected from the source
language to predict compound mergings. We integrate our approach
into end-to-end SMT and show that many compounds matching the
reference translation are produced which did not appear in the
training data. Additional manual evaluations support the usefulness
of generalizing compound formation in SMT.
