CimS - The CIS and IMS joint submission to WMT 2014: translating from
English into German.

Fabienne Cap, Marion Weller, Anita Ramm, Alexander Fraser 

We present the CimS submissions to the 2014 Shared Task for the
language pair English to German. We address the major problems that
arise when translating into German: complex nominal and verbal
morphology, productive compounding and flexible word ordering. Our
morphology-aware translation systems handle word formation issues on
different levels of morpho-syntactic modeling.
