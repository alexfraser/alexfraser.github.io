We present labeled morphological segmentation - an alternative view of
morphological processing that unifies several tasks. We introduce a
new hierarchy of morphotactic tagsets and CHIPMUNK, a discriminative
morphological segmentation system that, contrary to previous work,
explicitly models morphotactics. We show improved performance on
three tasks for six languages: (i) morphological segmentation, (ii)
stemming and (iii) morphological tag classification. For morphological
segmentation our method shows absolute improvements of 2-6 points F1
over a strong baseline.
