In this paper we present labeled morphological segmentation - an
alternative view of morphological processing that unifies several
tasks. We introduce a new hierarchy of morphotactic tagsets and
Cemimo, a discriminative morphological segmentation system that,
contrary to previous work, explicitly models morphotactics. Cemimo is
implemented as a semi-Markov Conditional Random Field (semi-CRF) that
has states for each morphotactic tag.  We show improved performance on
three tasks for six languages: (i) morphological segmentation, (ii)
stemming and (iii) morphological tag classification.
