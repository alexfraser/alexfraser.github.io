The published version had two mistakes:

1) a typo in the RANDLM 21.2 BLEU score in the German to English
results table, in the bottom row.

2) the English to German METEOR scores were wrong due to a script bug.

These two mistakes have been corrected in the version available on my
website, no other changes were made.

The fixed version is available from here:

The original version (with bugs) is available from here:
