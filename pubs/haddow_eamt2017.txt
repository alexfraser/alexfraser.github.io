EAMT 2017 Projects


HimL (www.himl.eu) is a three-year EU H2020 Innovation Action, which
started in February 2015. Its aim is to increase the availability of
public health information via automatic translation. Targeting
languages of Central and Eastern Europe (Czech, German, Polish and
Romanian) we aim to produce translations which are adapted to the
health domain, semantically accurate and morphologically correct.
