An Unsupervised System for Parallel Corpus Filtering

Viktor Hangya, Alexander Fraser

WMT 2018

In this paper we describe LMU Munich's submission for the WMT
2018 Parallel Corpus Filtering shared task which addresses the
problem of cleaning noisy parallel corpora. The task of mining and
cleaning parallel sentences is important for improving the quality of
machine translation systems, especially for low-resource languages.
We tackle this problem in a fully unsupervised fashion relying on
bilingual word embeddings created without any bilingual signal. After
pre-filtering noisy data we rank sentence pairs by calculating
bilingual sentence-level similarities and then remove redundant data
by employing monolingual similarity as well. Our unsupervised system
achieved good performance during the official evaluation of the shared
task, scoring only a few BLEU points behind the best systems, while
not requiring any parallel training data.
