To Act Or Not To Act - Annotating and Classifying Email Regarding Necessary Action

Veronika Hintzen, Alexander Fraser

KONVENS 2019

Every user of email is aware of the problem of reacting to emails that
require a time-sensitive action by the recipient while being
overwhelmed by informational emails. We define a new classification
problem to capture this distinction, creating comprehensive annotation
guidelines and carrying out annotation. We carry out a
proof-of-concept implementation of a classifier and discuss our future
research which will result in a tool that is usable in an everyday
business environment.
