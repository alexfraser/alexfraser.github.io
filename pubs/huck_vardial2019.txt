Cross-lingual Annotation Projection Is Effective for Neural Part-of-Speech Tagging

We tackle the important task of part-of-speech tagging using a neural
model in the zero-resource scenario, where we have no access to
gold-standard POS training data. We compare this scenario with the
low-resource scenario, where we have access to a small amount of
gold-standard POS training data. Our experiments focus on Ukrainian as
a representative of under-resourced languages. Russian is highly
related to Ukrainian, so we exploit gold-standard Russian POS tags. We
consider four techniques to perform Ukrainian POS tagging: zero-shot
tagging and cross-lingual annotation projection (for the zero-resource
scenario), and compare these with self-training and multilingual
learning (for the low-resource scenario). We find that cross-lingual
annotation projection works particularly well in the zero-resource
scenario.
