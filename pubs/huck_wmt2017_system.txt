This paper describes the LMU Munich English to German machine
translation systems. We participated with neural translation engines
in the WMT17 shared task on machine translation of news, as well as in
the biomedical translation task. LMU Munich's systems deliver
competitive machine translation quality on both news articles and
health information texts.
