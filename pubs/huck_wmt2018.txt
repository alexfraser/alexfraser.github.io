We present the LMU Munich machine translation systems for the
English-German language pair. We have built neural machine translation
systems for both translation directions (English->German and
German->English) and for two different domains (the biomedical domain
and the news domain). The systems were used for our participation in
the WMT18 biomedical translation task and in the shared task on
machine translation of news.

The main focus of our recent system development efforts has been on
achieving improvements in the biomedical domain over last year's
strong biomedical translation engine for English->German.
Considerable progress has been made in the latter task, which we
report on in this paper.
