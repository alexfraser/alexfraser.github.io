Grammatical tense and mood are important linguistic phenomena to
consider in natural language processing (NLP) research. We consider
the correspondence between English and German tense and mood in
translation. Human translators do not find this correspondence easy,
and as we will show through careful analysis, there are no simplistic
ways to map tense and mood from one language to another. Our
observations about the challenges of human translation of tense and
mood have important implications for multilingual NLP. Of particular
importance is the challenge of modeling tense and mood in rule-based,
phrase-based statistical and neural machine translation.
