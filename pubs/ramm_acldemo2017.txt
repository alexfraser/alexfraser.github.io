Annotating tense, mood and voice for English, French and German

Anita Ramm, Sharid LoaÃÅiciga, Annemarie Friedrich, Alexander Fraser

We present the first open-source tool for annotating morphosyntactic
tense, mood and voice for English, French and German verbal
complexes. The annotation is based on a set of language-specific
rules, which are applied on dependency trees and leverage information
about lemmas, morphological properties and POS-tags of the verbs. Our
tool has an average accuracy of about 76%. The tense, mood and voice
features are useful both as features in computational modeling and for
corpus-linguistic research.
