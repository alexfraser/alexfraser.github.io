Modeling verbal inflection for English to German SMT

German verbal inflection is frequently wrong in standard statistical
machine translation approaches. German verbs agree with subjects in
person and number, and they bear information about mood and tense. For
subject–verb agreement, we parse German MT output to identify
subject–verb pairs and ensure that the verb agrees with the
subject. We show that this approach improves subject-verb
agreement. We model tense/mood translation from English to German by
means of a statistical classification model. Although our model shows
good results on well-formed data, it does not systematically improve
tense and mood in MT output. Reasons include the need for discourse
knowledge, dependency on the domain, and stylistic variety in how
tense/mood is translated. We present a thorough analysis of these
problems.
