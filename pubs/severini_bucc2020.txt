BUCC 2020

The task of Bilingual Dictionary Induction (BDI) consists of
generating translations for source language words which is important
in the framework of machine translation (MT). The aim of the BUCC
2020 shared task is to perform BDI on various language pairs using
comparable corpora. In this paper, we present our approach to the
task of English-German and English-Russian language pairs. Our system
relies on Bilingual Word Embeddings (BWEs) which are often used for
BDI when only a small seed lexicon is available making them
particularly effective in a low-resource setting. On the other hand,
they perform well on high frequency words only. In order to improve
the performance on rare words as well, we combine BWE based word
similarity with word surface similarity methods, such as orthography
and transliteration information. In addition to the often used
top-$n$ translation method, we experiment with a margin based approach
aiming for dynamic number of translations for each source word. We
participate in both the open and closed tracks of the shared task and
we show improved results of our method compared to simple vector
similarity based approaches. Our system was ranked in the top-3
teams and achieved the best results for English-Russian.
