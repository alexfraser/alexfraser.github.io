Bilingual dictionary induction (BDI) is the task of accurately
translating words to the target language.  It is of great importance
in many low-resource scenarios where cross-lingual training data is
not available.  To perform BDI, bilingual word embeddings (BWEs) are
often used due to their low bilingual training signal requirements.
They achieve high performance, but problematic cases still remain,
such as the translation of rare words or named entities, which often
need to be transliterated.  In this paper, we enrich BWE-based BDI
with transliteration information by using Bilingual Orthography
Embeddings (BOEs). BOEs represent source and target language
transliteration word pairs with similar vectors.  A key problem in our
BDI setup is to decide which information source -- BWEs (or semantics)
vs. BOEs (or orthography) -- is more reliable for a particular word
pair.  We propose a novel classification-based BDI system that uses
BWEs, BOEs and a number of other features to make this decision.  We
test our system on English-Russian BDI and show improved performance.
In addition, we show the effectiveness of our BOEs by successfully
using them for transliteration mining based on cosine similarity.
