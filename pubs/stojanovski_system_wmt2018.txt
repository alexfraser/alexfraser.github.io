We describe LMU Munich's unsupervised machine translation systems for
English<->German translation. These systems were used to participate
in the WMT18 news translation shared task and more specifically, for
the unsupervised learning sub-track. The systems are trained on
English and German monolingual data only and exploit and combine
previously proposed techniques such as using word-by-word translated
data based on bilingual word embeddings, denoising and on-the-fly
backtranslation.
