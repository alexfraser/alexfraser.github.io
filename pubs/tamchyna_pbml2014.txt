Integrating a Discriminative Classifier into Phrase-based and Hierarchical Decoding

Current state-of-the-art statistical machine translation (SMT) relies
on simple feature functions which make independence assumptions at the
level of phrases or hierarchical rules. However, it is well-known that
discriminative models can benefit from rich features extracted from
the source sentence context outside of the applied phrase or hierarchical rule,
which is available at decoding time. We present a framework for the
open-source decoder Moses that allows discriminative models over
source context to easily be trained on a large number of examples and
then be included as feature functions in decoding.
