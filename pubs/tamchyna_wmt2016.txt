CUNI-LMU submissions in WMT2016: Chimera constrained and beaten
2016 WMT

This paper describes the phrase-based systems jointly submitted by
CUNI and LMU to English-Czech and English-Romanian News translation
tasks of WMT16. In contrast to previous years, we strictly limited our
training data to the constraint datasets, to allow for a reliable
comparison with other research systems. We experiment with using
several additional models in our system, including a feature-rich
discriminative model of phrasal translation.
