Modeling Target-Side Inflection in Neural Machine Translation

NMT systems have problems with large vocabulary sizes. Byte-pair
encoding (BPE) is a popular approach to solving this problem, but
while BPE allows the system to generate any target-side word, it does
not enable effective generalization over the rich vocabulary in
morphologically rich languages with strong inflectional phenomena. We
introduce a simple approach to overcome this problem by training a
system to produce the lemma of a word and its morphologically rich POS
tag, which is then followed by a deterministic generation step. We
apply this strategy for English–Czech and English–German translation
scenarios, obtaining improvements in both settings. We furthermore
show that the improvement is not due to only adding explicit
morphological information.
