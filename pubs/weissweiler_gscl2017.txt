GSCL 2017

Stemmers, which reduce words to their stems, are important components
of many natural language processing systems. In this paper, we conduct
a systematic evaluation of several stemmers for German using two gold
standards we have created and will release to the community. We then
present our own stemmer, which achieves state-of-the-art results, is
easy to understand and extend, and will be made publicly available
both for use by programmers and as a benchmark for further stemmer
development.

The stemmer is available at:
