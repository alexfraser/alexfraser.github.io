Using subcategorization knowledge to improve case prediction for translation to German

Marion Weller, Alexander Fraser, Sabine Schulte im Walde

This paper demonstrates the need and impact of subcategorization
information for SMT. We combine (i) features on source-side syntactic
subcategorization and (ii) an external knowledge base with
quantitative, dependency-based information about target-side
subcategorization frames. A manual evaluation of an English-to-German
translation task shows that the subcategorization information has a
positive impact on translation quality through better prediction of
case.
