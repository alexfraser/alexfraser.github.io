Using Noun Class Information to Model Selectional Preferences 
for Translating Prepositions in SMT

Marion Weller, Sabine Schulte im Walde, Alexander Fraser

Translating prepositions is a difficult and under-studied problem in
SMT.  We present a novel method to improve the translation of
prepositions by using noun classes to model their selectional
preferences.  We compare three variants of noun class information: (i)
classes induced from the lexical resource GermaNet or obtained from
clusterings based on either (ii) window information or (iii) syntactic
features.  Furthermore, we experiment with PP rule generalization.
While we do not significantly improve over the baseline, our results
demonstrate that (i) integrating selectional preferences as rigid
class annotation in the parse tree is sub-optimal, and that (ii)
clusterings based on window co-occurrence are more robust than
syntax-based clusters or GermaNet classes for the task of modeling
selectional preferences.
