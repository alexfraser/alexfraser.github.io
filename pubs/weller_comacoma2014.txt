Distinguishing Degrees of Compositionality in Compound Splitting for
Statistical Machine Translation

Marion Weller, Fabienne Cap, Stefan MÃ¼ller, Sabine Schulte im Walde, Alexander Fraser

The paper presents an approach to morphological compound splitting
that takes the degree of compositionality into account. We apply our
approach to German noun compounds and particle verbs within a
German-English SMT system, and study the effect of only splitting
compositional compounds as opposed to an aggressive splitting.  A
qualitative study explores the translational behaviour of
non-compositional compounds.
