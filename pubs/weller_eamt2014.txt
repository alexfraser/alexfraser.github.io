Combining Bilingual Terminology Mining and Morphological Modeling for Domain Adaptation in SMT

Marion Weller, Alexander Fraser, Ulrich Heid

Translating in technical domains is a well-known problem in SMT, as
the lack of parallel documents causes significant problems of
sparsity.  We discuss and compare different strategies for enriching
SMT systems built on general domain data with bilingual terminology
mined from comparable corpora.  In particular, we focus on the
target-language inflection of the terminology data and present a
pipeline that can generate previously unseen inflected forms.
