Target-side Generation of Prepositions for SMT

Marion Weller, Alexander Fraser, Sabine Schulte im Walde

We present a translation system that models the selection of
prepositions in a target-side generation component. This novel
approach allows the modeling of all subcategorized elements of a verb
as either NPs or PPs according to target-side requirements relying on
source and target side features. The BLEU scores are encouraging, but
fail to surpass the baseline. We additionally evaluate the preposition
accuracy for a carefully selected subset and discuss how typical
problems of translating prepositions can be modeled with our method.
