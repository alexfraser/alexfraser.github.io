Predicting Prepositions for SMT
Marion Weller, Alexander Fraser, Sabine Schulte im Walde

The translation of prepositions is a difficult task for machine
translation; a preposition must convey the source-side meaning and
also meet target-side constraints. In our approach, we move the
selection of prepositions out of the translation system into a
post-processing component. During translation, we use an abstract
representation of prepositions as a place-holder that serves as a
basis for the generation of prepositions in the post-processing step.
In this step all subcategorized elements of a verb are considered and
allotted to their respective functions – as PPs with an overt
preposition or as NPs with an “empty” preposition.
