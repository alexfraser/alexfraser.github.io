Addressing Problems across Linguistic Levels in SMT: Combining Approaches to Model Morphology, Syntax and Lexical Choice

Many errors in phrase-based SMT can be attributed to problems on three
linguistic levels: morphological complexity in the target language,
structural differences and lexical choice. We explore combinations of
linguistically motivated approaches to address these problems in
English-to-German SMT and show that they are complementary to one
another, but also that the popular verbal pre-ordering can cause
problems on the morphological and lexical level. A discriminative
classifier can overcome these problems, in particular when enriching
standard lexical features with features geared towards verbal
inflection.
