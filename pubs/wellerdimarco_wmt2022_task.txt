Findings of the WMT 2022 Shared Tasks in Unsupervised MT and Very Low Resource Supervised MT

Marion Weller-Di Marco and Alexander Fraser

2022 Conference on Machine Translation (WMT)

We present the findings of the WMT2022 Shared Tasks in Unsupervised MT
and Very Low Resource Supervised MT with experiments on the language
pairs German to/from Upper Sorbian, German to/from Lower Sorbian and
Lower Sorbian to/from Upper Sorbian. Upper and Lower Sorbian are
minority languages spoken in the Eastern parts of Germany. There are
active language communities working on the preservation of the
languages who also made the data used in this Shared Task available.
In total, four teams participated on this Shared Task, with
submissions from three teams for the unsupervised sub task, and
submissions from all four teams for the supervised sub task. In this
overview paper, we present and discuss the results.
