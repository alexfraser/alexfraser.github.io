<H1>Understanding my research (for non-researchers)</H1>

<P>Taken broadly, my research area constitutes the field of Computational
Linguistics, which is also called Natural Language Processing. In
Computational Linguistics the focus is on building computer systems
which can process human language. Automatic speech recognition and internet
search engines are two examples of the successful application of
theories of Computational Linguistics to important
problems.

<P>Computational Linguistics is an interdisciplinary area that lies at
the intersection of two fields, Computer Science and Linguistics. With
respect to Computer Science, the main area of study is computational
models of high complexity. For instance, in the problem of Information
Retrieval, a document can be thought of as a vector in a
high-dimensional space (where the dimensions either correspond to individual
words or correspond to loose collections of words representing
ideas). From Linguistics, Computational Linguistics draws knowledge of
how human languages vary and ideas about how humans process language,
which are critical to implementing computer systems which can operate
on, or even attempt to understand, human language.

<P>My specific research interests are the two related problems of
Machine Translation and Cross-Language Information Retrieval. Machine
Translation is the problem of using an automatic computer system to
translate text from one human language to another, for instance from
English to German. Machine Translation is a very difficult problem
which has been the subject of a great deal of active research since
the 1950s.

<P>Cross-Language Information Retrieval is the creation of document
searching systems (such as Internet search engines) where a query is
given in one language, and the documents which are searched are in
another language. For instance, the query might be given in English,
while the documents searched are in German. Technology of this type
might allow an American lawyer to search German court cases without
needing to know German. In combination with a cost-effective and
accurate Machine Translation system, it is easy to see how an
individual could use a collection of documents that are written in a
language that she/he does not speak. There is tremendous 
demand for both of these technologies, with the availability of
documents in many different languages on the Internet being a key
factor in driving this demand.
