    <p><b>Titel der Arbeit:</b> (BA) POS-tagging for spoken language
      corpora
    </p>
    <p><b>Beschreibung:</b> One important dimension of domain is genre,
      such as spoken
      language. Genre adaptation for spoken language needs to overcome
      general problems with the tools we use, such as POS-tagging, and
      the
      lack of information which is easy to see in text (i.e., the lack
      of
      punctuation, upper vs. lower case, etc). For the interesting
      linguistic problems of disfluencies and repairs, an important
      challenge is adapting our POS-taggers to speech input by
      explicitly
      detecting these phenomena. This topic consists of looking at
      previous
      approaches to POS-tagging of spoken language, training a
      POS-tagger
      such as Lemming for this task, and performing an error analysis.
    </p>
    <p><b> Voraussetzungen:</b> Interest in rich POS tags and linguistic
      analysis, some programming
      background

    <p><b>Titel der Arbeit:</b> (BA) Comparative Error Analysis of
      Machine Translation into Slavic Languages
    </p>
    <p><b>Beschreibung:</b> Machine translation (MT) systems are often
      developed without much regard for the language pair at hand.
      However, knowledge of the types of errors that MT makes for a
      particular language pair can be essential for improving the
      translation system. In this work, we propose to carry out a
      comparative analysis of errors that MT systems make when
      translating from English into two different Slavic languages:
      Czech (West Slavic) and Russian (East Slavic). There are several
      existing taxonomies of translation errors which can utilized. The
      task consists of developing MT systems for both language pairs,
      creating translations of representative test sets and analyzing MT
      errors in both outputs, looking for systematic similarities and
      differences. Ideally, the student would propose and possibly
      evaluate ways of improving the systems based on this analysis.

    <p><b>Titel der Arbeit:</b> (BA or MA) Domain Adaptation for
      Discriminative Machine Translation Models
    </p>
    <p><b>Beschreibung:</b> Domain mismatch is a well-known problem of
      statistical machine translation (MT) systems. Parallel data which
      are used for training MT systems often come from a different topic
      or genre than the data that the user needs to translate. The
      system then learns a model of translation probability which can be
      inadequate for real use. Domain adaptation techniques are
      therefore often deployed to mitigate this issue. Recently,
      discriminative translation models have become popular in MT but
      their adaptation to new text domains has not been thoroughly
      studied. The goal of this thesis is to implement several standard
      domain adaptation techniques (such as "frustratingly easy" domain
      adaptation or instance weighting) and to evaluate them
      intrinsically on realistic datasets for MT.

    <p><b>Titel der Arbeit:</b> (BA or MA) Parallelization of Neural
      Machine Translation
    </p>
    <p><b>Beschreibung:</b> There has been a huge progress in using deep
      learning for practical
      applications such as Neural Machine Translation. This approach
      provides interesting alternatives to Statistical Machine
      Translation
      (e.g., Moses) due to the architectural differences. Currently, the
      training time of NMT takes about one week for training for
      moderate
      sized parallel corpus (i.e. a couple of millions sentence pairs)
      on a
      GPU. This project aims at reducing the training time by
      parallelization.
    </p>
    <p>Among various parallel algorithms which have been proposed up to
      now,
      this project will focus on the parallelization of conventional
      training algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and
      Adagrad. The topic will involve understanding this previous work
      on parallel training and implementing it in the context of neural
      machine translation.
    </p>
    <p><b> Voraussetzungen:</b> Familiarity with neural networks and
      optimization. Ability to understand and modify Neural Machine
      Translation training implementation.

    <p><b>Titel der Arbeit:</b> (MA) Statistical Machine Translation to
      Russian with Full Morphological Generalization
    </p>
    <p><b>Beschreibung:</b> Translation to morphologically rich
      languages such as Russian, with its rich inflection system, is
      difficult due to data sparsity in terms of infrequent inflected
      surface forms. In this bachelor thesis you will build an EN-RU
      news translation system with full generalization of grammatical
      features such as case, gender and number. This topic also involves
      participating in a shared task for EN-RU news translation.

      morphology, scripting, statistical machine translation, supervised
      classification
