<H1>USC and Computational Linguistics</H1>

USC has excellent resources for Computational Linguistics. There is a
very strong Natural Language Group at the Information Sciences
Institute which has 7 full-time researchers and more than 10 graduate
students. On the USC campus, there are many faculty interested in
problems related to Computational Linguistics in the Computer Science,
Linguistics, and Electrical Engineering departments. Also, USC has
recently begun a Masters program in Computational Linguistics, which
has increased the number of students working in this area.
